                    <p>Introduction to Shushi</p>
                    <p>Sushi is perhaps the most famous Japanese food in the world. Sushi is defined as any dish that is made with vinegared sushi rice. Although you can make sushi without using any fish or raw fish, many kinds of seafood are used in sushi
                        dishes. Since Japan is surrounded by ocean, seafood has always been widely consumed as well as rice. Originally, sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt, and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand years until
                        the Edo Period (1603 to 1868) when contemporary sushi was developed. The word "sushi" means "it's sour," which reflects back to sushi's origins of being preserved in salt. Contemporary sushi was developed to be a type of fast food
                        and remains so to this day.
